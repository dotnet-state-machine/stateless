//<Description>
// Code coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program 
// is tested by a particular test suite. A program with high code coverage, measured as a percentage, 
// has had more of its source code executed during testing which suggests it has a lower chance of 
// containing undetected software bugs compared to a program with low code coverage.
//
// Code coverage is certainly the most important quality code metric. But coverage is not enough
// the team needs to ensure that results are checked at test-time. These checks can be done both 
// in test code, and in application code through assertions. The important part is that a test
// must fail explicitely when a check gets unvalidated during the test execution.
//
// This quality gate define a warn threshold (70%) and a fail threshold (80%). These are 
// indicative thresholds and in practice the more the better. To achieve high coverage and 
// low risk, make sure that new and refactored classes gets 100% covered by tests and that
// the application and test code contains as many checks/assertions as possible.

//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// Types with many lines of code
// should be split in a group of smaller types.
// 
// To refactor a *God Class* you'll need patience, 
// and you might even need to recreate everything from scratch.
// Here are a few refactoring advices:
//
// • The logic in the *God Class* must be splitted in smaller classes.
// These smaller classes can eventually become private classes nested
// in the original *God Class*, whose instances objects become 
// composed of instances of smaller nested classes.
//
// • Smaller classes partitioning should be driven by the multiple
// responsibilities handled by the *God Class*. To identify these 
// responsibilities it often helps to look for subsets of methods
// strongly coupled with subsets of fields.
//
// • If the *God Class* contains way more logic than states, a good 
// option can be to define one or several static classes that 
// contains no static field but only pure static methods. A pure static 
// method is a function that computes a result only from inputs
// parameters, it doesn't read nor assign any static or instance field.
// The main advantage of pure static methods is that they are easily
// testable.
// 
// • Try to maintain the interface of the *God Class* at first 
// and delegate calls to the new extracted classes. 
// In the end the *God Class* should be a pure facade without its own logic.
// Then you can keep it for convenience or throw it away and 
// start to use the new classes only.
//
// • Unit Tests can help: write tests for each method before extracting it 
// to ensure you don't break functionality.
//
// The estimated Debt, which means the effort to fix such issue,
// varies linearly from 1 hour for a 200 lines of code type,
// up to 10 hours for a type with 2.000 or more lines of code.
//
// In Debt and Interest computation, this rule takes account of the fact 
// that static types with no mutable fields are just a collection of 
// static methods that can be easily splitted and moved from one type 
// to another.

//<Description>
// This rule is based on the *LCOM code metric*,
// LCOM stands for **Lack Of Cohesion of Methods**.
// See the definition of the LCOM metric here 
// https://www.ndepend.com/docs/code-metrics#LCOM
//
// The LCOM metric measures the fact that most methods are using most fields.
// A class is considered utterly cohesive (which is good)
// if all its methods use all its instance fields.
//
// Only types with enough methods and fields are taken account to avoid bias.
// The LCOM takes its values in the range [0-1].
//
// This rule matches types with LCOM higher than 0.8.
// Such value generally pinpoints a **poorly cohesive class**.
//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// To refactor a poorly cohesive type and increase code quality and maintainability,
// certainly you'll have to split the type into several smaller and more cohesive types
// that together, implement the same logic.
//
// The estimated Debt, which means the effort to fix such issue,
// varies linearly from 5 minutes for a type with a low poorCohesionScore,
// up to 4 hours for a type with high poorCohesionScore.

// A classic example is a *ISession* large interface, responsible

// In *Object-Oriented Programming*, the **open/closed principle** states:
// *software entities (components, classes, methods, etc.) should be open 
// for extension, but closed for modification*. 
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle
//
// Hence a base class should be designed properly to make it easy to derive from,
// this is *extension*. But creating a new derived class, or modifying an
// existing one, shouldn't provoke any *modification* in the base class.
// And if a base class is using some derivative classes somehow, there
// are good chances that such *modification* will be needed.
//
// Extending the base class is not anymore a simple operation,
// this is not good design.
//
// Note that this rule doesn't warn when a base class is using a derived class 
// that is nested in the base class and declared as private. In such situation
// we consider that the derived class is an encapsulated implementation
// detail of the base class.
//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// Understand the need for using derivatives, 
// then imagine a new design, and then refactor.
//
// Typically an algorithm in the base class needs to access something 
// from derived classes. You can try to encapsulate this access behind 
// an abstract or a virtual method.
//
// If you see in the base class some conditions on *typeof(DerivedClass)*

// This is because *inheritance* comes with pitfalls.

//
// On the other hands, *Composition* favors binding with interfaces

// When an instance method can be *safely* declared as static you should declare it as static.
//
// Whenever you write a method, you fulfill a contract in a given scope. 
// The narrower the scope is, the smaller the chance is that you write a bug.
//
// When a method is static, you can't access non-static members; hence, your scope is
// narrower. So, if you don't need and will never need (even in subclasses) instance
// fields to fulfill your contract, why give access to these fields to your method? 
// Declaring the method static in this case will let the compiler check that you 
// don't use members that you do not intend to use.
//
// Declaring a method as static if possible is also good practice because clients can 
// tell from the method signature that calling the method can't alter the object's state.
//
// Doing so, is also a micro performance optimization, since a static method is a 
// bit cheaper to invoke than an instance method, because the *this* reference* 
// doesn't need anymore to be passed.
//
// Notice that if a matched method is a handler, bound to an event through code  
// generated by a designer, declaring it as static might break the designer 
// generated code, if the generated code use the *this* invocation syntax, 
// (like *this.Method()*).
//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// Declare matched methods as static.
//
// Since such method doesn't use any instance fields and methods of its type and 
// base-types, you should consider if it makes sense, to move such a method

// This rule matches constructors of a non-sealed class that call one or

//
// When an object written in C# is constructed, what happens is that constructors 
// run in order from the base class to the most derived class.
//
// Also objects do not change type as they are constructed, but start out as 
// the most derived type, with the method table being for the most derived type. 
// This means that virtual method calls always run on the most derived type,
// even when calls are made from the constructor.
//
// When you combine these two facts you are left with the problem that if you 
// make a virtual method call in a constructor, and it is not the most derived 
// type in its inheritance hierarchy, then it will be called on a class whose 
// constructor has not been run, and therefore may not be in a suitable state

// At first glance, this pattern looks appealing, it is simple to implement,
// it adresses a common situation, and as a consequence it is widely used.
//
// However, we discourage you from using singleton classes because experience
// shows that **singleton often results in less testable and less maintainable code**.
// Singleton is *by-design*, not testable. Each unit test should use their own objects
// while singleton forces multiple unit-tests to use the same instance object.
//
// Also the singleton static *GetInstance()* method allows *magic* access to that 
// single object and its state from wherever developers want! This potentially
// attractive facility unfortunatly ends up into *unorganized*/*messy* code that 
// will require effort to be refactored.

//<HowToFix>
// This rule matches *the classic syntax of singletons*, where one   
// static field hold the single instance of the parent class. We underline that

// The problem is not the fact that a single instance of the class lives 
// at runtime.
//
// Hence to fix matches fo this rule, creates the single instance 
// at the startup of the program, and pass it to all classes and methods
// that need to access it.
//
// If multiple singletons are identified, they actually form together a 
// *program execution context*. Such context can be unified in a unique
// singleton context. Doing so will make it easier to propagate the 
// context across the various program units.
//
// The estimated Debt, which means the effort to fix such issue,

// *Int32*, *Double*, *Char* or *Boolean* are structures and not classes.

// Hence a class is candidate to be turned into a structure
// when its instances are *lightweight values*.
//

// works with plenty of *short lived lightweight values*.
// In such situation, the advantage of using *struct* instead of
// *class*, (in other words, the advantage of using *values* instead
// of *objects*), is that *values* are not managed by the garbage collector.
// This means that values are cheaper to deal with. 
//
// This rule matches classes that looks like being *lightweight values*.
// The characterization of such class is:
//
// • It has instance fields.
//
// • All instance fields are typed with value-types (primitive, structure or enumeration)
//
// • It is immutable (the value of its instance fields cannot be modified once the constructor ended).
//
// • It implements no interfaces.
//
// • It has no parameterless construtor.
//
// • It is not generic.
//
// • It has no derived classes.
//
// • It derives directly from *System.Object*.
//
// • ASP.NETCore ViewModel (its name ends with *Model*) and Repository
//
// This rule doesn't take account if instances of matched
// classes are numerous *short-lived* objects.

//<Description>
// This rule lists types and methods from a low-level namespace
// that use types and methods from higher-level namespace.
//
// The pair of low and high level namespaces is made of two
// namespaces that use each other.
//
// For each pair of namespaces, to infer which one is low-level
// and which one is high-level, the rule computes the two coupling
// [from A to B] and [from B to A] in terms of number of types, 
// methods and fields involved in the coupling. Typically
// the coupling from low-level to high-level namespace is significantly
// lower than the other legitimate coupling.
//
// Following this rule is useful to avoid **namespaces dependency 
// cycles**. This will get the code architecture close to a 
// *layered architecture*, where *low-level* code is not allowed
// to use *high-level* code.
//
// In other words, abiding by this rule will help significantly
// getting rid of what is often called **spagetthi code:
// Entangled code that is not properly layered and structured**.
//
// More on this in our white books relative to partitioning code.
// https://www.ndepend.com/docs/white-books
//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// Refactor the code to make sure that **the low-level namespace 
// doesn't use the high-level namespace**.
//
// The rule lists in detail which low-level types and methods 
// shouldn't use which high-level types and methods. The refactoring 
// patterns that help getting rid of each listed dependency include:
//
// • Moving one or several types from the *low-level* namespaces
// to the *high-level* one, or do the opposite.
//
// • Use *Inversion of Control (IoC)*: 
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control
// This consists in creating new interfaces in the
// *low-level* namespace, implemented by classes
// in the *high-level* namespace. This way *low-level* 
// code can consume *high-level* code through interfaces, 
// without using directly *high-level* implementations.
// Interfaces can be passed to *low-level* code through
// the *high-level* namespace code, or through even 
// higher-level code. In related documentations 
// you can see these interfaces named as *callbacks*, 
// and the overall pattern is also known as 
// *Dependency Injection (DI)*:
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection
//
// That rule might not be applicable for frameworks
// that present public namespaces mutually dependent.
// In such situation the cost to break the API can be
// higher than the cost to let the code entangled.
//
// -
//
// The estimated **Debt**, which means the effort to fix such issue
// to make sure that the first namespace doesn't rely anymore
// on the second one, depends on the number of types and methods used.
//
// Because both namespace are now forming a *super-component*
// that cannot be partitioned in smaller components, the cost to 
// unfix each issue is proportional to the size of this super-component.
// As a consequence, the estimated **Annual Interest**, which means 
// the annual cost to let both namespaces mutually dependend, is equal 
// to an hour plus a number of minutes proportional to the size 
// (in lines of code) of both namespaces. The obtained *Annual Interest* 
// value is then divided by the number of detailled issues listed.
//
// Often the estimated *Annual Interest* for each listed issue 
// is higher than the *Debt*, which means that leaving such issue
// unfixed for a year costs more than taking the time to fix issue once.
//
// --
//
// To explore the coupling between the two namespaces mutually 
// dependent:
// 
//  1) from the *becauseNamespace right-click menu* choose
// *Copy to Matrix Columns* to export this low-level namespace
// to the horizontal header of the dependency matrix.
//
//  2) from the *shouldntUseNamespace right-click menu* choose
// *Copy to Matrix Rows* to export this high-level namespace to 
// the vertical header of the dependency matrix.
//
//  3) double-click the black matrix cell (it is black because of
// the mutual dependency).
//
//  4) in the matrix command bar, click the button: 
// *Remove empty Row(s) and Column(s)*.
//
// At this point, the dependency matrix shows types involved 
// into the coupling.
//
// • Blue cells represent types from low-level namespace using types 
// from high-level namespace
//
// • Green cells represent types from high-level namespace using 
// types from low-level namespace
//
// • Black cells represent types from low-level and high-level
// namespaces that use each other.
//
// There are more green cells than blue and black cells because
// green cell represents correct coupling from high-level to low-level.

//
// Once solving all *mutually dependent namespaces*, remaining cycles

// Violations of this rule indicate assemblies with an improper 
// *abstractness / stability* balance.
//
// • Either the assembly is *potentially painful to maintain* (i.e is massively
// used and contains mostly concrete types). This can be fixed by creating 
// abstractions to avoid too high coupling with concrete implementations.
//
// • Either the assembly is *potentially useless* (i.e contains mostly
// abstractions and is not used enough). In such situation, the design
// must be reviewed to see if it can be enhanced.
//
// The severity of issues of this rule is **Low** because
// the *Abstractness/Instability principle* is an information 
// about the code structure state but **is not actionable**, 
// it doesn't tell precisely what to do obtain a better score.
//
// Fixing actionable issues of others **Architecture** and 
// **Code Smells** default rules will necessarily push 
// the *Abstractness/Instability principle* scores in the 
// right direction.

// • the method code size and complexity
//
// • the actual percentage coverage
//
// • the abstractness of types used, because relying on classes instead of

//
// • the method visibility because testing private or protected
// methods is more difficult than testing public and internal ones

// • the fields used by the method, because is is more complicated to

//
// • whether the method is considered *JustMyCode* or not because *NotMyCode*
// is often generated easier to get tested since tests can be generated as well.

// The Formula is:  **CRAP(m) = CC(m)^2 * (1 – cov(m)/100)^3 + CC(m)**

// • Non 100% covered code, difficult to refactor without introducing any regression bug.
//
// The higher the CRAP score, the more painful to maintain and error prone is the method.
//
// An arbitrary threshold of 30 is fixed for this code rule as suggested by inventors.

//<Description>
// This rule lists *potentially* **dead types**.
// A dead type is a type that can be removed
// because it is never used by the program.
//
// This rule lists not only types not used anywhere in code,
// but also types used only by types not used anywhere in code.
// This is why this rule comes with a column *TypesusingMe* and
// this is why there is a code metric named *depth*:
//
// • A *depth* value of *0* means the type is not used.
//
// • A *depth* value of *1* means the type is used only by types not used.
//
// • etc…
//
// By reading the source code of this rule, you'll see that by default,
// *public* types are not matched, because such type might not be used
// by the analyzed code, but still be used by client code, not analyzed by NDepend.
// This default behavior can be easily changed.
//
// Note that this rule doesn't match Entity Framework ModelSnapshot classes
// that are used ony by the EF infrastructure.
//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// *Static analysis* cannot provide an *exact* list of dead types,
// because there are several ways to use a type *dynamically* (like through reflection).
//
// For each type matched by this query, first investigate if the type is used somehow
// (like through reflection).
// If the type is really never used, it is important to remove it 
// to avoid maintaining useless code.
// If you estimate the code of the type might be used in the future, 
// at least comment it, and provide an explanatory comment about the future intentions.
//
// If a type is used somehow,
// but still is matched by this rule, you can tag it with the attribute 
// **IsNotDeadCodeAttribute** found in *NDepend.API.dll* to avoid matching the type again.
// You can also provide your own attribute for this need, 
// but then you'll need to adapt this code rule.
//
// Issues of this rule have a **Debt** equal to 15 minutes because it only
// takes a short while to investigate if a type can be safely discarded.

// This rule warns about constant fields that are visible outside their 
// parent assembly. Such field, when used from outside its parent assembly,
// has its constant value *hard-coded* into the client assembly.
// Hence, when changing the field's value, it is *mandatory* to recompile 
// all assemblies that consume the field, else the program will run
// with different constant values in-memory. Certainly in such situation
// bugs are lurking.
//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// Declare matched fields as **static readonly** instead of **constant**. 
// This way, the field value is *safely changeable* without the need to 
// recompile client assemblies.
//
// Notice that enumeration value fields suffer from the same *potential
// pitfall*. But enumeration values cannot be declared as 
// *static readonly* hence the rule comes with the condition
// **&& !f.IsEnumValue** to avoid matching these. Unless you decide

// • For a static field, the class constructor that assigns the field is not counted.

// The default threshold for *instance fields* is equal to *4 or more than 4 methods

// Indeed, such situation potentially involves global random accesses from

// 
// If the object containing such field is meant to be used from multiple threads,

// When multiple threads are involved, the rule of thumb is to use immutable objects.

//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// There is no straight advice to refactor the number of methods responsible 
// for assigning a field. Sometime the situation is simple enough, like when
// a field that hold an indentation state is assigned by many writer methods.
// Such situation only requires to define two methods *IndentPlus()/IndentMinus()* 
// that assign the field, called from all writers methods.
//
// Sometime the solution involves rethinking and then rewriting 
// a complex algorithm. Such field can sometime become just a variable accessed 
// locally by a method or a *closure*. Sometime, just rethinking the life-time 
// and the role of the parent object allows the field to become immutable 
// (i.e assigned only by the constructor).
//
// The estimated Debt, which means the effort to fix such issue,
// is equal to 4 minutes plus 5 minutes per method assigning the instance field
// or 10 minutes per method assigning the static field.

// Because the field is read-only it cannot be changed to refer

//<HowToFix>
// To fix the security vulnerability that is identified by

//
// • Replace the array with a strongly typed collection

// *System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyList<T>* ;
// *System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyCollection<T>* ;
// *System.Collections.ReadOnlyCollectionBase*
//
// • Or replace the public field with a method that returns a clone 
// of a private array. Because your code does not rely on 
// the clone, there is no danger if the elements are modified.
//
// By default issues of this rule have a **Low** severity

// A good practice to make the code more readable and more predictable
// is to name properties and fields typed with a collection of *items*
// with the plural form of *Items*.
//
// Depending on the domain of your application, a proper identfier could be
// *NewDirectories*, *Words*, *Values*, *UpdatedDates*.
//
// Also this rule doesn't warn when any word in the identifier ends with an *s*.
// This way identifiers like **TasksToRun**, **KeysDisabled**, **VersionsSupported**,
// **ChildrenFilesPath**, **DatedValuesDescending**, **ApplicationNodesChanged**
// or **ListOfElementsInResult** are valid and won't be seen as violations.
//
// Moreover this rule won't warn for a field or property with an identifier
// that contain the word **Empty**.
// This is a common pattern to define an immutable and empty collection instance 
// shared.
//
// Before inspecting properties and fields, this rule gathers 
// application and third-party collection types that might be returned 
// by a property or a field. To do so this rule searches types that implement 
// *IEnumerable<T>* except:
//
// - Non generic types: Often a non generic type is not seen as a collection.
//   For example *System.String* implements *IEnumerable<char>*, but a string
//   is rarely named as a collection of characters. In others words,
//   we have much more strings in our program named like *FirstName*
//   than named like *EndingCharacters*.
//
// - Dictionaries types: A dictionary is more than a collection of pairs, 
//   it is a mapping from one domain to another. A common practice is to suffix
//   the name of a dictionary with *Map* *Table* or *Dictionary*, 
//   although often dictionaries names satify this rule with names like
//   *GuidsToPersons* or *PersonsByNames*.
//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// Just rename the fields and properties accordingly,
// by making plural the word in the identifier
// that describes best the *items* in the collection.
//
// For example:
//
// - **ListOfDir** can be renamed **Directories**.

//<Description>
// A writable collection property allows a user to replace the collection with 
// a completely different collection. A read-only property stops the collection 
// from being replaced but still allows the individual members to be set. If 
// replacing the collection is a goal, the preferred *design pattern* is to include
// a method to remove all the elements from the collection and a method to 
// re-populate the collection. See the *Clear()* and *AddRange()* methods of the 
// *System.Collections.Generic.List<T>* class for an example of this pattern.
// 
// Both binary and XML serialization support read-only properties that are 
// collections. The *System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer* class has specific 
// requirements for types that implement *ICollection* and *System.Collections.IEnumerable*
// in order to be serializable.
//
// This rule matches property setter methods that assign a collection object.
//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// To fix a violation of this rule, make the property read-only and, if 
// the design requires it, add methods to clear and re-populate the collection.

// It is generic hence you get strongly typed elements.
// Also, it is faster with *T* as a value types since it avoids boxing.
//
// For the same reasons:

//
// • **Stack<T>** should be prevered over **Stack**.
//
// • **SortedDictionary<K,V>** or **SortedList<K,V>** should be prevered over **SortedList**.
//
// You can be forced to use *non generic* collections

// Typically this happens when the analyzed code base is made of assemblies 
// that are not *compiled, developed or deployed* together.
//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// If all assemblies of your application should have the same version number,
// just use the attribute **System.Reflection.AssemblyVersion** in a source 
// file shared by the assemblies.
//
// Typically this source file is generated by a dedicated *MSBuild* task 
// like this one http://www.msbuildextensionpack.com/help/4.0.5.0/html/d6c3b5e8-00d4-c826-1a73-3cfe637f3827.htm.

// Here you can find interesting assemblies versioning advices.
// http://stackoverflow.com/a/3905443/27194

// By default issues of this rule have a severity set to **major** since
// unproper assemblies versioning can lead to complicated deployment problem.

//<Description>
// **Code Contracts** are useful to decrease ambiguity between callers and callees.
// Not ensuring that a reference returned by a method is *non-null* leaves ambiguity 
// for the caller. This rule matches methods returning an instance of a reference type 
// (class or interface) that doesn't use a **Contract.Ensure()** method.
//
// *Contract.Ensure()* is defined in the **Microsoft Code Contracts for .NET** 
// library, and is typically used to write a code contract on returned reference:
// *Contract.Ensures(Contract.Result<ReturnType>() != null, "returned reference is not null");*
// https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1ec7db13-3363-46c9-851f-1ce455f66970
//</Description>

//<HowToFix>
// Use *Microsoft Code Contracts for .NET* on the public surface of your API,
// to remove most ambiguity presented to your client. Most of such ambiguities
// are about *null* or *not null* references.
//
// Don't use *null* reference if you need to define a method that might not 
// return a result. Use instead the **TryXXX()** pattern exposed for example 
// in the *System.Int32.TryParse()* method.
//
// The estimated Debt, which means the effort to fix such issue, is equal
// to 5 minutes per public application method that might return a null reference 
// plus 3 minutes per method calling such method.

//<Description>
// **TypeRank** values are computed by applying

// high *Rank* are the most used ones. Not necessarily

// used by many types, themselves having a lot of

// See the definition of the TypeRank metric here: 
// https://www.ndepend.com/docs/code-metrics#TypeRank
//
// This code query lists the 100 application types 
// with the higher rank.
//
// The main consequence of being used a lot for a 
// type is that each change (both *syntax change* 
// and *behavior change*) will result in potentially
// a lot of **pain** since most types clients will be 
// **impacted**.
//
// Hence it is preferable that types with higher 
// *TypeRank*, are **interfaces**, that are typically  
// less subject changes.

//<Description>
// **MethodRank** values are computed by applying 
// the **Google PageRank** algorithm on the 
// graph of methods' dependencies. Methods with 
// high *Rank* are the most used ones. Not necessarily
// the ones with the most callers methods, but the ones
// called by many methods, themselves having a lot 
// of callers.
//
// See the definition of the MethodRank metric here: 
// https://www.ndepend.com/docs/code-metrics#MethodRank
//
// This code query lists the 100 application methods 
// with the higher rank.
//
// The main consequence of being used a lot for a 
// method is that each change (both *signature change* 
// and *behavior change*) will result in potentially
// a lot of **pain** since most methods callers will be 
// **impacted**.
//
// Hence it is preferable that methods with highest 
// *MethodRank*, are **abstract methods**, that are 
// typically less subject to signature changes.
//
// Also abstract methods avoid callers relying on  
// implementations details. Hence, when the code
// of a method implementing an abstract method changes, 
// this shouldn't impact callers of the abstract method.
// This is *in essence* the 
// **Liskov Substitution Principle**.
