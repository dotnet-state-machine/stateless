**Create *state machines* and lightweight *state machine-based workflows* directly in .NET code:**

```csharp
var phoneCall = new StateMachine<State, Trigger>(State.OffHook);

phoneCall.Configure(State.OffHook)
    .Permit(Trigger.CallDialled, State.Ringing);

phoneCall.Configure(State.Connected)
    .OnEntry(t => StartCallTimer())
    .OnExit(t => StopCallTimer())
    .InternalTransition(Trigger.MuteMicrophone, t => OnMute())
    .InternalTransition(Trigger.UnmuteMicrophone, t => OnUnmute())
    .InternalTransition<int>(_setVolumeTrigger, (volume, t) => OnSetVolume(volume))
    .Permit(Trigger.LeftMessage, State.OffHook)
    .Permit(Trigger.PlacedOnHold, State.OnHold);

// ...

phoneCall.Fire(Trigger.CallDialled);
Assert.AreEqual(State.Ringing, phoneCall.State);
```

This project, as well as the example above, was inspired by [Simple State Machine (Archived)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170814020207/http://simplestatemachine.codeplex.com/).

## Features

Most standard state machine constructs are supported:

 * Generic support for states and triggers of any .NET type (numbers, strings, enums, etc.)
 * Hierarchical states
 * Entry/exit actions for states
 * Guard clauses to support conditional transitions
 * Introspection

Some useful extensions are also provided:

 * Ability to store state externally (for example, in a property tracked by an ORM)
 * Parameterised triggers
 * Reentrant states
 * Export to DOT graph
 * Export to mermaid graph

### Hierarchical States


In the example below, the `OnHold` state is a substate of the `Connected` state. This means that an `OnHold` call is still connected.

```csharp
phoneCall.Configure(State.OnHold)
    .SubstateOf(State.Connected)
    .Permit(Trigger.TakenOffHold, State.Connected)
    .Permit(Trigger.PhoneHurledAgainstWall, State.PhoneDestroyed);
```

In addition to the `StateMachine.State` property, which will report the precise current state, an `IsInState(State)` method is provided. `IsInState(State)` will take substates into account, so that if the example above was in the `OnHold` state, `IsInState(State.Connected)` would also evaluate to `true`.

### Entry/Exit actions

In the example, the `StartCallTimer()` method will be executed when a call is connected. The `StopCallTimer()` will be executed when call completes (by either hanging up or hurling the phone against the wall.)

The call can move between the `Connected` and `OnHold` states without the `StartCallTimer()` and `StopCallTimer()` methods being called repeatedly because the `OnHold` state is a substate of the `Connected` state.

Entry/Exit action handlers can be supplied with a parameter of type `Transition` that describes the trigger, source and destination states.

### Internal transitions

Sometimes a trigger needs to be handled, but the state shouldn't change. This is an internal transition. Use `InternalTransition` for this.

### Initial state transitions

A substate can be marked as initial state. When the state machine enters the super state it will also automatically enter the substate. This can be configured like this:

```csharp
    sm.Configure(State.B)
        .InitialTransition(State.C);

    sm.Configure(State.C)
        .SubstateOf(State.B);
```

Due to Stateless' internal structure, it does not know when it is "started". This makes it impossible to handle an initial transition in the traditional way. It is possible to work around this limitation by adding a dummy initial state, and then use Activate() to "start" the state machine.

```csharp
    sm.Configure(InitialState)
        .OnActivate(() => sm.Fire(LetsGo))
        .Permit(LetsGo, StateA)
```


### External State Storage

Stateless is designed to be embedded in various application models. For example, some ORMs place requirements upon where mapped data may be stored, and UI frameworks often require state to be stored in special "bindable" properties. To this end, the `StateMachine` constructor can accept function arguments that will be used to read and write the state values:

```csharp
var stateMachine = new StateMachine<State, Trigger>(
    () => myState.Value,
    s => myState.Value = s);
```

In this example the state machine will use the `myState` object for state storage.

Another example can be found in the JsonExample solution, located in the example folder. 


### Activation / Deactivation

It might be necessary to perform some code before storing the object state, and likewise when restoring the object state. Use `Deactivate` and `Activate` for this. Activation should only be called once before normal operation starts, and once before state storage. 

### Introspection

The state machine can provide a list of the triggers that can be successfully fired within the current state via the `StateMachine.PermittedTriggers` property. Use `StateMachine.GetInfo()` to retrieve information about the state configuration.

### Guard Clauses

The state machine will choose between multiple transitions based on guard clauses, e.g.:

```csharp
phoneCall.Configure(State.OffHook)
    .PermitIf(Trigger.CallDialled, State.Ringing, () => IsValidNumber)
    .PermitIf(Trigger.CallDialled, State.Beeping, () => !IsValidNumber);
```

```csharp
phoneCall.Configure(State.OffHook)
    .PermitIfAsync(Trigger.CallDialled, State.Ringing, async () => await IsValidNumber())
    .PermitIfAsync(Trigger.CallDialled, State.Beeping, async () => !await IsValidNumber());
```

Guard clauses within a state must be mutually exclusive (multiple guard clauses cannot be valid at the same time.) Substates can override transitions by respecifying them, however substates cannot disallow transitions that are allowed by the superstate.

The guard clauses will be evaluated whenever a trigger is fired. Guards should therefore be made side effect free.

### Parameterised Triggers

Strongly-typed parameters can be assigned to triggers:

```csharp
var assignTrigger = stateMachine.SetTriggerParameters<string>(Trigger.Assign);

stateMachine.Configure(State.Assigned)
    .OnEntryFrom(assignTrigger, email => OnAssigned(email));

stateMachine.Fire(assignTrigger, "joe@example.com");
```

Trigger parameters can be used to dynamically select the destination state using the `PermitDynamic()` configuration method.

### Ignored Transitions and Reentrant States

In Stateless, firing a trigger that does not have an allowed transition associated with it will cause an exception to be thrown. This ensures that all transitions are explicitly defined, preventing unintended state changes.

To ignore triggers within certain states, use the `Ignore(TTrigger)` directive:

```csharp
phoneCall.Configure(State.Connected)
    .Ignore(Trigger.CallDialled);
```

Alternatively, a state can be marked reentrant. A reentrant state is one that can transition back into itself. In such cases, the state's exit and entry actions will be executed, providing a way to handle events that require the state to reset or reinitialize.

```csharp
stateMachine.Configure(State.Assigned)
    .PermitReentry(Trigger.Assigned)
    .OnEntry(() => SendEmailToAssignee());
```

A state can also have a conditional reentrant, both synchronous and asynchronous.

```csharp
stateMachine.Configure(State.Assigned)
    .PermitReentryIf(Trigger.Assigned, () => ShouldSendEmailAgain())
    .OnEntry(() => SendEmailToAssignee());
```

```csharp
stateMachine.Configure(State.Assigned)
    .PermitReentryIfAsync(Trigger.Assigned, async () => await ShouldSendEmailAgain())
    .OnEntry(() => SendEmailToAssignee());
```

By default, triggers must be ignored explicitly. To override Stateless's default behaviour of throwing an exception when an unhandled trigger is fired, configure the state machine using the `OnUnhandledTrigger` method:

```csharp
stateMachine.OnUnhandledTrigger((state, trigger) => { });
```

### Dynamic State Transitions and State Re-entry

Dynamic state transitions allow the destination state to be determined at runtime based on trigger parameters or other logic.

```csharp
stateMachine.Configure(State.Start)
    .PermitDynamic(Trigger.CheckScore, () => score < 10 ? State.LowScore : State.HighScore);
```

When a dynamic transition results in the same state as the current state, it effectively becomes a reentrant transition, causing the state's exit and entry actions to execute. This can be useful for scenarios where the state needs to refresh or reset based on certain triggers.

```csharp
stateMachine.Configure(State.Waiting)
    .OnEntry(() => Console.WriteLine($"Elapsed time: {elapsed} seconds..."))
    .PermitDynamic(Trigger.CheckStatus, () => ready ? State.Done : State.Waiting);
```

### State change notifications (events)

Stateless supports 2 types of state machine events:
 * State transition
 * State machine transition completed

#### State transition
```csharp
stateMachine.OnTransitioned((transition) => { });
```
This event will be invoked every time the state machine changes state.

#### State machine transition completed
```csharp
stateMachine.OnTransitionCompleted((transition) => { });
```
This event will be invoked at the very end of the trigger handling, after the last entry action has been executed.

### Export to DOT graph

It can be useful to visualize state machines on runtime. With this approach the code is the authoritative source and state diagrams are by-products which are always up to date.
 
```csharp
phoneCall.Configure(State.OffHook)
    .PermitIf(Trigger.CallDialled, State.Ringing, IsValidNumber);
    
string graph = UmlDotGraph.Format(phoneCall.GetInfo());
```

The `UmlDotGraph.Format()` method returns a string representation of the state machine in the [DOT graph language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)), e.g.:

```dot
digraph {
  OffHook -> Ringing [label="CallDialled [IsValidNumber]"];
}
```

This can then be rendered by tools that support the DOT graph language, such as the [dot command line tool](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/command.html) from [graphviz.org](http://www.graphviz.org) or [viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js). See http://www.webgraphviz.com for instant gratification.
Command line example: `dot -T pdf -o phoneCall.pdf phoneCall.dot` to generate a PDF file.

### Export to Mermaid graph

Mermaid graphs can also be generated from state machines.
 
```csharp
phoneCall.Configure(State.OffHook)
    .PermitIf(Trigger.CallDialled, State.Ringing);
    
string graph = MermaidGraph.Format(phoneCall.GetInfo());
```

The `MermaidGraph.Format()` method returns a string representation of the state machine in the [Mermaid](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams#creating-mermaid-diagrams), e.g.:

```
stateDiagram-v2
     [*] --> OffHook
    OffHook --> Ringing : CallDialled
```

This can be rendered by GitHub markdown or an engine such as [Obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd).

``` mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
     [*] --> OffHook
    OffHook --> Ringing : CallDialled
```

### Async triggers

On platforms that provide `Task<T>`, the `StateMachine` supports `async` entry/exit actions and so on:

```csharp
stateMachine.Configure(State.Assigned)
    .OnEntryAsync(async () => await SendEmailToAssignee());
```

Asynchronous handlers must be registered using the `*Async()` methods in these cases.

To fire a trigger that invokes asynchronous actions, the `FireAsync()` method must be used:

```csharp
await stateMachine.FireAsync(Trigger.Assigned);
```

**Note:** while `StateMachine` may be used _asynchronously_, it remains single-threaded and may not be used _concurrently_ by multiple threads.


## Calling triggers from multiple threads on the same instance of State Machine (using SM as a shared resource)

To fire a trigger from a thread safely, the `FireThreadSafeAsync()` method must be used:

```csharp
await stateMachine.FireThreadSafeAsync(Trigger.Assigned); //the await is entirely optional, you can fire-and-forget
```

The state machine itself will remain single-threaded internally, and the firing mechanism invoked by different threads is managed simply using a lock. 
The state machine unlocks and will ingest the next trigger only when all actions relating to the firing of the last trigger, such as `PermitDynamic`, `OnEntry` and `OnExit` are executed.

Calling `FireThreadSafeAsync` from two different threads will therefore result in the two triggers happening sequentially, akin to many siblings coming from all around the house to use the bathroom at the same time - the one that gets in first will finish their business in peace, and the rest will wait in the lobby in front of the loo, essentially forming a queue.
If you do not want to block the firing threads or await the firing process to be over, you can safely just fire-and-forget your triggers from different threads "at" the state machine. 

#### On developing a well-behaving thread-safe state machine

Example: State machine is in state S, and triggers T1 and T2 can happen at about the same time, from different threads. 
Therefore, assuming that T1 would normally lead to a transition from S to S1 state, and accordingly for T2 and S2, it is important to note that there are two ways things can occur:

```mermaid
graph LR;

S --[trigger T1 from thread1]--> S1 --[trigger T2 from thread2]--> NEW_STATE1
S --[trigger T2 from thread2]--> S2 --[trigger T1 from thread1]--> NEW_STATE2
```
It is the __duty of the developer__ to handle these occurences, and to define the behaviour of the state machine so that it can mirror the events in the real world. 
If any trigger can happen at any time, Stateless may not be the right solution for you. 

I reccomend using `OnUnhandledTrigger` capability mixed with logging to manage race conditions during development, and perhaps introducing a _TState.Panic_ state that the state machine transfers to on the appearance of an unexpected trigger. The latter will disable the default behaviour of `OnUnhandledTrigger` method, which is looping back to the source state.

## Advanced Features ##

### Retaining the SynchronizationContext ###
In specific situations where all handler methods must be invoked with the consumer's `SynchronizationContext`, set the `RetainSynchronizationContext` property on creation:

```csharp
var stateMachine = new StateMachine<State, Trigger>(initialState)
{
    RetainSynchronizationContext = true
};
```

Setting this is vital within a Microsoft Orleans Grain for example, which requires the `SynchronizationContext` in order to make calls to other Grains.

## Building

Stateless runs on .NET runtime version 4+ and practically all modern .NET platforms by targeting .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 8.0. Visual Studio 2017 or later is required to build the solution.

## Project Goals

This page is an almost-complete description of Stateless, and its explicit aim is to remain minimal.

Please use the issue tracker or the Discussions page if you'd like to report problems or discuss features.

(_Why the name? Stateless implements the set of rules regarding state transitions, but, at least when the delegate version of the constructor is used, doesn't maintain any internal state itself._)
